# ROV Simulator

## Purpose
  This Repository contains all of the source files used within my ROV simulator. 
  It was made for the University of Alaska Fairbanks CS486 Computer Graphics Animation & Simulation

  Inspiration for the project was the work being done by [EV/Natuilus](https://nautiluslive.org/) specifically [the footage of their dive](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CZzQhiNQXxU) done in October 2019 on the whalefall at the Davidson Seamount

  Footage of the Simulator running can be found [>here<](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X8mR3FNYswM)
